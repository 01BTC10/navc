navc is a daemon to index and navigate your C code. It watches for all file
changes and automatically update the index. It provides a RPC API to ask for
definition, declaration, calls, and uses of some symbol. This API can be used
by any editor plugin to point to the correct location of the looked up symbol.
navc uses clang to parse the file. Having the abstract syntax tree of the code
can be very powerful as it can know with greater exactitude the location of the
declaration or definition being looked up. The project is limited to C for now,
but it can be extended to C++ as clang it is able to parse it.

navc is in its early stages. There is still plenty of code to be written.

Requirements
============
For the daemon you need the following libraries:
* libclang: https://github.com/sbinet/go-clang
* fsnotify: https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify
* sqlite3: https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3

For the vim plugin to work, you need vim with python support. You also need to
include the jsonrpc file in the PYTHONPATH env variable. Examples can be found
in navc.vim.
